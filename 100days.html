Instructions
Lucian's girlfriend is on her way home, and he hasn't cooked their anniversary dinner!

In this exercise, you're going to write some code to help Lucian cook an exquisite lasagna from his favorite cookbook.

You have four tasks related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

1. Define the expected oven time in minutes
Define the EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN constant that represents how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven. It must be exported. According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is 40.

2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes
Implement the remainingMinutesInOven function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a parameter and returns how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven, based on the expected oven time in minutes from the previous task.
